# About the Project

FDF is a project by Escola 42 that aims to create a three-dimensional representation of a 2D map using isometric projection. The program receives a map file containing elevation information and generates a 3D visual representation. To do this, we use MLX (MiniLibX), a low-level graphics library provided by 42.
